# 🍅 Tomato Timer — Pomodoro Web App

This project is a simple, interactive **Pomodoro-style timer** built as part of the CodePath Summer Internship Lab: *The Case of the Coded Message (Tomato Timer)*.

The timer helps structure work sessions using the **Pomodoro Technique** — 25 minutes of focused work followed by 5-minute breaks. It's styled for clarity, supports dynamic interactions, and includes several stretch goal features.
Deployed the web app on vercel: [App Link Here](https://tomato-timer-lab-unit-2.vercel.app/)

- ⏲️ Timer display updates every second using `setInterval`.
- 🖱️ Study and Break buttons use event listeners to start their respective sessions.
- 🔢 Study and break session counters update dynamically.
- 🧠 DOM manipulation using `getElementById`, `textContent`, and `classList`.

### Stretch Goals Completed
- 🎨 **Visual Feedback**: Background color changes depending on session type:
  - Green for study sessions
  - Red for break sessions
  - Grey when paused
- 🛑 **Pause & Reset**:
  - Pause button halts the timer without resetting progress
  - Reset button restores the timer to its original state
- 🔁 **Automatic Breaks** (optional if implemented): Ability to automatically switch between sessions and manage long breaks (if included)
